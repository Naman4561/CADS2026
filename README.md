# HABI_v2_exoplanets


## Overview


The Objective of this project is to discover habitable exoplanets and assess their potential for supporting life. This was completed for the Zero Gravity data challenge hackathon that was hosted by University of North Carolina's computer science department. 
## Notebook contents

- `HABI_v2_exoplanets.ipynb` — main analysis notebook
  - Data loading and cleaning
  - Feature engineering (radiative flux, equilibrium temperature, etc.)
  - Habitability index computation (HABI v2)
  - Visualizations and summary tables
  - Modeling and classification experiments

## Requirements and setup

This repository includes a pinned dependency file: `requirements.txt`. To reproduce the analysis, create an isolated Python environment and install the dependencies from that file.

Recommended approaches:

- Using Python venv (Windows PowerShell):

```
python -m venv env
.\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Using pip in an existing (virtual) environment:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Using conda:

```
conda create -n habi python=3.10; conda activate habi; pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you prefer to install packages manually, the main packages used in the analysis include: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, astropy, astroquery, and jupyterlab. The `requirements.txt` file pins tested versions; update it with `pip freeze > requirements.txt` if you make changes to the environment.

Note: The environment was developed against Python 3.10+; compatibility with later Python versions is likely but not guaranteed without testing.

## Running the notebook

1. Start Jupyter Lab or Notebook:

```
jupyter lab
# or
jupyter notebook
```

2. Open `HABI_v2_exoplanets.ipynb` and execute cells interactively.

Optional: export results to HTML:

```
jupyter nbconvert --to html HABI_v2_exoplanets.ipynb
```

## Data sources and notes

- Common sources: NASA Exoplanet Archive, Kepler/K2/TESS catalogs.
- External datasets should be cited; large datasets should be referenced via download scripts or external links rather than committed to the repository.
- See cell comments in the notebook for assumptions and parameter choices.

## Outputs and artifacts

- Figures and summary CSVs can be generated by running the relevant notebook cells. Consider adding an `outputs/` directory to store reproducible artifacts.

## Contributing and contact

Please open issues or submit pull requests for improvements. For changes that affect reproducibility, include or update the `requirements.txt` and document the environment used.
